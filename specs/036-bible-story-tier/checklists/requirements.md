- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- 3 clarifications resolved during 2026-02-08 session: scripture reference dual role, collapsible template sections, guided prompt field.
- Key Entities section mentions TierConfig and StoryTemplate by name — these are domain concepts in this project, not implementation details. Acceptable per convention in prior specs.
- Assumptions section documents the tier extensibility expectation from the constitution, which is important context for planning.
